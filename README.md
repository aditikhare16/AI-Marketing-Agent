# Marketing Campaign Optimization

## Overview
This project is a Flask-based web application designed to automate the analysis and optimization of marketing campaigns. It ingests campaign data, calculates key performance metrics, applies defined optimization rules, generates insights, and visualizes campaign performance.

## Features
- Data Ingestion: Upload campaign data from a CSV file.
- Preprocessing: Handle missing values and normalize metrics.
- Analysis: Calculate metrics such as CTR, ROAS, and CPA.
- Decision Making: Apply rules for pausing, increasing, or decreasing campaign budgets.
- AI Insights: Generate insights using OpenAI's language model.
- Visualization: Create and save visualizations for campaign performance.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Flask
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- OpenAI SDK
- MongoDB
- dotenv

## Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/marketing-campaign-optimization.git
   cd marketing-campaign-optimization
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:
     ```env
     FLASK_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
     ```

5. **Run the Flask app**:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

   Your app will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## Sample Input Data

### Required CSV Format
Create a CSV file named `campaign_data.csv` with the following columns:

| Campaign ID | Impressions | Clicks | Conversions | Spend | Revenue | Status  |
|-------------|-------------|--------|-------------|-------|---------|---------|
| 001         | 10000       | 120    | 15          | 500   | 2000    | Active  |
| 002         | 8000        | 80     | 8           | 300   | 1000    | Active  |

**Explanation of columns**:
- **Campaign ID**: Unique identifier for the campaign.
- **Impressions**: Number of times the ad was shown.
- **Clicks**: Number of times the ad was clicked.
- **Conversions**: Number of successful outcomes (e.g., sales, sign-ups).
- **Spend**: Total amount spent on the campaign.
- **Revenue**: Total revenue generated from the campaign.
- **Status**: Current status of the campaign (e.g., "Active", "Paused").

## Usage

1. **Upload CSV File**:
   - Navigate to the homepage (`/`) of the app.
   - Click the upload button and select the `campaign_data.csv` file.
   - The app will process the file and store data in MongoDB.

2. **View Insights**:
   - After processing, visit `/insights` to see the optimization report and insights generated by the app.

## Sample Output
The report generated will include:
- Actions taken (e.g., pause, increase, or decrease budget).
- Generated insights suggesting improvements for ad creatives or targeting.
